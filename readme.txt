Motivation:
    In our experience, we have found that many students who are novices in using
    command line find it very obtuse and alien. They also fear learning by
    trial-and-error for the fear of messing up something irreversibly, due to a
    lack of hand-holding from such interfaces. This results in a lack of soft skills
    in using Linux and other UNIX systems, which then hampers the expression of the
    student's hard skills. An example of such phenomena would be an inability to write
    Makefiles due to not being proficient with the way compilers accept arguments on
    the command line. Thus, we found ourselves motivated to find a way to create an
    approachable, non-threatening teaching environment for command line interfaces,
    aimed at new users.

Compile:
    Install Clang 8.0, then run `build.linux` in project's root directory.

Run:
    Execute the following command in project's root directory:
            ./bin/linux/x64/game
